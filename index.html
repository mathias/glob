      Hi there! This is a very early prototype for puzzles in the game <span class="title">blip_rot</span>.</p>
      <p><span class="title">blip_rot</span> is a game of adventure, set in the world of Arc. Something has gone terribly wrong in Arc, tearing apart the world itself. You embark on a quest to find out what happened and ultimately, fix the world. Throughout the journey, you'll be accompanied by a little flying robot, seen at the right. The robot will help you through the various challenges by providing information and history. Your companion won't be fully functional for *this* prototype, but will try to give you some hints.</p>
      <p>The main type of puzzles I'm working on use a visual programming language to solve simple coding problems. I've named this programming language <span class="title">glob</span>. You'll be able to do lots with <span class="title">glob</span>'s blocks in the game, but mostly you will use it to solve puzzles.</p>
      <p>Your feedback will help determine how the puzzles appear in the game. At the end of the puzzles, I have a link to a survey, and I would really appreciate it if you filled it out. Thanks and have fun!  &mdash; <a href="https://twitter.com/mathiasx">@mathiasx</a></p>

      <p> This is the workbench. You will work on puzzles inside it.</p>
      <p>We're starting with some basic math. Solve the problem below so that we get the expected output. The code in the workbench executes as you make changes.</p>
